        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare herbed mayo: In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, dried herbs, Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice, mixing well. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Cut each strip of bacon in half and cook in a skillet over medium heat until crisp.</li>
            <li>Remove and drain on paper towels. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon drippings from the pan.</li>
            <li>Add mushroom slices and soy sauce to the pan.</li>
            <li>Over medium heat, saute mushrooms until browned and soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>To prepare burgers, mix ground beef, garlic granules, and salt and pepper together in a bowl. Form into patties. Place on prepared grill and grill 3 to 5 minutes per each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
            <li>During last 2 minutes of cooking, top with cheese and cover to melt cheese.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oven to 400 degrees, arrange hamburger buns on a foil-lined cookie sheet and lightly toast hamburger buns in the oven on each side.</li>
            <li>When toasted, remove buns to serving plates and spread some of the herbed mayonnaise on each bun.</li>
            <li>To serve, put cheese-topped patties on each bun, add desired hamburger trimmings, finish with the top bun and enjoy.</li>
